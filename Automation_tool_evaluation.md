### [A. Codeceptjs Introduction](#a-introduction): 
CodeceptJS bypasses execution commands to helpers. Depending on the helper enabled, your tests will be executed differently. If you need cross-browser support you should choose Selenium-based WebDriver or TestCafé. If you are interested in speed - you should use Chrome-based Puppeteer. Therefore, we could say this tool is very flexible and easily maintained.
